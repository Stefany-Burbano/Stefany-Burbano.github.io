          <h3>Climate Risk and the Insurability of Commercial Real Estate</h3>
          <p>
            In recent years, the real estate market has seen a significant increase in average insurance costs.
            We examine the impact of extreme weather events and climate-related risks on insurance expenses for
            commercial properties. Our findings suggest that this trend is driven in part by the growing losses
            from increasingly severe hurricanes and a heightened awareness of climate risks within insurance markets.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:10px;">
            Leveraging data on commercial property insurance expenditures, natural disasters, and forward-looking
            climate risk indicators, we find evidence that properties with greater exposure to extreme weather events
            face higher insurance costs relative to total operating expenses. Using a differences-in-differences approach,
            we show that properties impacted by recent disasters, such as Hurricane Ian, experienced an increase in
            insurance costs within three quarters post-event.

          <h3>Are climate related risks priced in corporate loan interest rates?</h3>
          <p>
            The purpose of this project is to investigate to what extent climate-related risks are priced into corporate
            loans and to identify the transmission channels through which climate shocks affect loans interest rates.
            Banks are currently more exposed to borrowers facing growing climate-related risks. This combination of heightened
            exposure, coupled with bank-specific characteristics, could increase the probability of a systemic shock if these
            risks are not fully priced into loans.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:10px;">
            In this context, it is necessary to study not only the direct damages to firms' physical capital and the business
            disruptions caused by climate-related shocks, but also the indirect effects, such as borrowers' reduced ability to repay
            debts and the increased likelihood of default.
